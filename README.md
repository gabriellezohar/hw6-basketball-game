  - ‚Üë / ‚Üì: Forward/Backward movement
  - ‚Üê / ‚Üí: Left/Right movement
- **W / S Keys**: Adjust shot power (increases/decreases shooting strength)
- **Spacebar**: Shoot basketball toward nearest hoop
- **R Key**: Reset basketball to center court position
- **G Key**: Reset game statistics (score, attempts, percentage)

### Camera Controls:
- **Mouse**: Orbit, zoom, and pan around the scene
- **O Key**: Toggle camera controls on/off

## Physics System Implementation
### Realistic Basketball Physics:
- **Gravity Simulation**: Constant downward acceleration (-9.8 m/s¬≤ scaled)
- **Parabolic Trajectory**: Realistic arc physics for shot trajectories
- **Bounce Mechanics**: Energy loss on each bounce (60% energy retention)
- **Air Resistance**: Slight velocity reduction during flight (98% retention)
- **Ground Collision**: Accurate collision detection with energy loss
- **Court Boundaries**: Ball bounces off court edges with reduced velocity

### Advanced Collision Detection:
- **Rim Collision Detection**: 
  - Side collision detection for missed shots
  - Top collision detection prevents unrealistic ball passage through rim
  - Proper scoring detection when ball passes through hoop center
- **Realistic Rim Physics**: 
  - Ball deflection based on impact angle and velocity
  - Energy loss and random spin effects on rim contact
- **Score Detection**: Ball must be moving downward through hoop center area

### Basketball Rotation System:
- **Movement Rotation**: Ball rotates based on ground movement direction and speed
- **Flight Rotation**: Realistic spin during trajectory based on velocity vector
- **Collision Rotation**: Random spin effects added during rim/ground impacts
- **Friction Effects**: Rotation gradually slows due to air resistance and ground friction

## Comprehensive Scoring System
### Real-Time Statistics:
- **Total Score**: Points earned from successful shots (2 points per basket)
- **Shot Attempts**: Total number of shots taken (spacebar presses)
- **Shots Made**: Number of successful baskets
- **Shooting Percentage**: Calculated as (Shots Made / Shot Attempts) √ó 100%

### Visual Feedback System:
- **Success Messages**: "SHOT MADE!" displayed for successful shots
- **Miss Messages**: "MISSED SHOT" displayed for unsuccessful attempts
- **Shot Power Indicator**: Live power bar showing current shooting strength
- **Color-Coded Power**: Green (low), Yellow (medium), Red (high power)
- **Real-Time Updates**: All statistics update immediately upon shot completion
